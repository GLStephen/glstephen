### Greetings!

I'm a Principal Engineer at Black Airplane in Woodstock, GA (just outside Atlanta). I'm also the Founder/CTO of <a href="https://pubwise.io">PubWise.io</a> which provides solutions for publishers to wrangle complexity in AdTech. I'm also the Founder of Launch Media Network, the creators of <a href="https://www.GameSkinny.com">GameSkinny.com</a> and <a href="https://www.gamerlaunch.com">GamerLaunch.com</a>. At heart I'm a problem solving, data digging, value stream focused tinkerer and builder. I've been involved in all stages and evolutions of internet applications, programmatic advertising, big data engineering, SaaS and machine learning usually before the patterns and names were in common usage.

I also <a href="https://www.gambasta.com/">provide consulting</a> to a select group of clients doing interesting work, with a focus on building software products that efficiently deliver value.
